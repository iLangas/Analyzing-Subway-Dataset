# Analyzing-Subway-Dataset

We tried to Analyse the data from a subway in the span of some months in respect to the subway's usage by taking into account a huge
set of dependent variables. A predictive model was build using regression techniques (linear and polynomial) in conjuction with gradient
descent and ordinary least squares estimation of the regression's coefficients.

The histogram of the data, as well the residuals (difference between observed value of the dependent variables that were used and
the predicted value) and finally the linearity of regression coefficients, are plotted for extra insight.
